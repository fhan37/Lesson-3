      <p>This will serve as a little exercise to see how well all this stuff is clicking, in addition to getting you comfortable with some more advanced styling techniques. This is a screenshot of a site.</p>

      <h2>1. Some boxes in a row.</h2>
      <p>Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.</p>
      <span class="box">B</span>
      <span class="box special">L</span>
      <span class="box">O</span>
      <span class="box">C</span>

      <h2>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h2>
      <p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like <span>width: 100%;</span>. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like <span>font-family: monospace;</span>.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <h2>3. This is a big link.</h2>
      <p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.</p>
